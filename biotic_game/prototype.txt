1. detect Euglena in a video feed (microscope camera or recorded video)
2. track their position and movement direction (2D)
3. plot their trajectories in live
4. store data to check if they are moving towards a light source

Tools
- OpenCV > image processing and tracking
- Matplotlib > visualisation

Sources: MP4, AVI, webcam

Issues
- prioritise organisms who move and are well in focus
> use Laplacian variance (focus measure)
low values (== blurry) will be ignored

- to prioritise moving organisms we can compare a few consequent frames 
and exclude low displacement
